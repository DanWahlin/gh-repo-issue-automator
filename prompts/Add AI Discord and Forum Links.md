Title: Add AI Discord and GitHub Community Links

# Plan

Locate the README.md file in the root of the project and add the following content at the bottom of the file if "Getting Help" section and the links do not already exist in the README.md file. If the README.md file already contains a section for AI Discord or the Azure AI Foundry Developer Form, do not add the links again.

**RULES**:
- ONLY MODIFY the README.md file at the root of the repository. DO NOT MODIFY any other files.
- If the "Getting Help" section does not already exists, add it to the bottom of the README.md, but before "Contributing" and "Trademarks" section if they exists at the bottom.
- If there's a badges section in the README.md that do not already include an "AI Community", "Discord" or "AI Discord" (or similar):
  * also add this badge after the Codespaces one (if applicable) `[![Join Azure AI Foundry Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Azure_AI_Community-blue?style=flat-square&logo=discord&color=5865f2&logoColor=fff)](https://aka.ms/foundry/discord)`
  * if needed, adapt the badge styling to match the other existing badges

```
