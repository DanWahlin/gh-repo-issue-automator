Title: Add AI Discord and GitHub Community Links

# Plan

Locate the README.md file in the root of the project and add the following content at the bottom of the file if "Getting Help" section and the links do not already exist in the README.md file. If the README.md file already contains a section for AI Discord or the Azure AI Foundry Developer Form, do not add the links again.

**RULES**:
- ONLY MODIFY the README.md file at the root of the repository. DO NOT MODIFY any other files.

```
